            <h1>INTRODUCTION</h1>
            <p>
                &emsp;It is survey about identification of students who choose intermediate or diploma in an area. For this     survey we selected an area called Venkateswarapuram in Nellore District. For this we look for the students who choose intermediate or diploma after completion ofSSC that which deals with the parameters of academic performance, interests, parental influence and career aspiration, etc. This survey is about the student’s career and study that which helps in fulfilling their aspirations. For this survey we gone to some houses in our area and asked them. Whether the student selected intermediate or diploma. And hence we arranged collected information in below table.
                 <br> <br>
            
                &emsp;Education plays a fundamental role in shaping an individual's future, especially during key transitional phases. One such critical juncture in the Indian education system is the stage after the Secondary School Certificate (SSC), commonly referred to as the 10th grade. At this point, studentsface an important decision that sets the course for their future academic and career paths: whether topursue Intermediate (Inter) education or enroll in a Diploma course..<br> <br>
                
                &emsp;Intermediate education typically spans two years and includes streams such as MPC
(Maths, Physics, Chemistry), BIPC (Biology, Physics, Chemistry), MEC (Maths, Economics,Commerce), and CEC (Civics, Economics, Commerce). It serves as a preparatory phase for students aiming to enter professional degree programs in engineering, medicine, commerce, and the arts. On the other hand, Diploma courses offer a more practical and technical approach to education, often lasting three years, and are designed for students who are interested in entering the workforce earlier
or pursuing engineering or technology-related careers through lateral entry into degree programs.
                
            <br><br>
            <p>&emsp;The choice between Inter and Diploma is influenced by various factors, includingacademic performance, parental guidance, socio-economic background, peer influence, awareness of career opportunities, and personal interests. In many cases, students lack adequate guidance or information, leading them to choose a path that may not align with their long-term goals or strengths.
This study aims to identify and understand the trends and reasons behind the choices students make after SSC. It will explore how demographic, psychological, and environmental factors contribute to their decisions. By analyzing these patterns, the study hopes to shed light on how educational institutions and career counselors can better support students in making informed choices. Ultimately,the goal is to ensure that students are guided toward paths where they are more likely to succeed and find fulfillment in their careers.
The primary objective of this study is to identify the factors influencing students’ decisions to choose either
Intermediate or Diploma education after completing their SSC. <br>
 The study aims to:  <br>
1. Understand the preferences and trends among students regarding the choice between Inter and Diploma.  <br>
2. Analyze the socio-economic, academic, and personal factors that impact this decision. <br>
3. Assess the level of awareness students have about the long-term implications of both educational paths. <br>
4. Identify the role of parents, teachers, and peer groups in guiding students' decisions. <br>
5. Provide suggestions to schools, career counselors, and education departments for improving guidance at the SSC level.</p>
            <br><br>

            <h3>METHODOLOGY:</h3>
            <p>&emsp;This study will be conducted using both qualitative and quantitative research methods. Data will be
collected from students who have recently completed their SSC and have chosen either Intermediate or Diploma courses.
 The methodology includes:  <br>
• Survey/Questionnaire: A structured questionnaire will be distributed to students across various schools and                                     polytechnic colleges to gather data on their choices, motivations, and backgrounds. <br>
 • Interviews: A set of semi-structured interviews will be conducted with selected students, teachers, and parents to gain deeper insights.  <br>
 • Data Analysis: The collected data will be analyzed using basic statistical tools to identify common trends, correlations, and                                                    influencing factors.   <br>
 • Sampling: The study will include a diverse sample of students from different geographical, socioeconomic, and academic   backgrounds to ensure a balanced and comprehensive analysis.
                </p>
            <p>&emsp;After completing their Secondary School Certificate (SSC), students in India are faced with
  an important decision: whether to pursue Intermediate (commonly referred to as "Inter") or enroll in a Diploma course. This    choice significantly shapes their future academic and career paths. Intermediate education is typically chosen by students who wish to continue with academic studies in streams like science, commerce, or humanities, and prepare for professional entrance exams such as NEET, JEE, or CA Foundation. On the other hand, Diploma courses are more technical and skill-oriented, attracting students who prefer hands-on learning and aim to enter the workforce earlier or pursue engineering through lateral entry.  <br><br>

         The decision is influenced by several factors, including the student’s academic performance, career goals, family background, financial status, and the guidance they receive from parents, teachers, or counselors. Unfortunately, many students make this decision without adequate career awareness or counseling, leading to confusion or regret later. Therefore, understanding the motivations and circumstances behind these choices is essential for providing better guidance and ensuring students followa path aligned with their interests and strengths.
           <br><br>

            Therefore, this study aims to explore and analyze the reasons behind student’s choices between Intermediate and Diploma after SSC. By identifying these factors, we can help create more effective guidance systems to support students in making informed, future-oriented decisions.
